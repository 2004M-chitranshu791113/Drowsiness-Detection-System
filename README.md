# Driver Drowsiness Detection using Deep Learning

A real-time Driver Drowsiness Detection System built using Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques.  
This project uses CNN-based models along with MediaPipe Face Mesh for eye detection and monitoring driver alertness in real time.

# Features

- Real-time drowsiness detection using webcam
- Eye state classification (Open / Closed)
- MediaPipe Face Mesh for facial landmark detection
- CNN-based deep learning models
- Alarm alert when drowsiness is detected
- Training and dataset preparation scripts included

# Models Used

The following CNN architectures were experimented with:

- InceptionV3
- VGG16
- ResNet50V2

Among these, **ResNet50V2** achieved the best accuracy and robustness.

---

# Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation can be downloaded from:

https://datasets.esdalab.ece.uop.gr/download-files/

After downloading, extract and organize the dataset before running the training scripts.

---

# Installation

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2004M-chitranshu791113/Drowsiness-Detection-System.git
cd Drowsiness-Detection-System
```

---

## 2. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# Running the Project

Run the real-time drowsiness detection system using:

```bash
python realtime.py
```

The webcam will open and the system will monitor eye state in real time.

If drowsiness is detected continuously, an alarm will be triggered.
